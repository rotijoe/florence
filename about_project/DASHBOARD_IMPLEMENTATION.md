# Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a dashboard page for authenticated users to view their name and health tracks, following TDD principles and the component-structure rules.

## What Was Built

### 1. API Backend - User Me Endpoint

**Files Created:**

- `apps/api/src/routes/user/index.ts` - API endpoint implementation
- `apps/api/src/routes/user/index.test.ts` - API endpoint tests

**Functionality:**

- GET `/api/user/me` endpoint that returns current user's information with health tracks
- Requires authentication via Better Auth session
- Returns 401 if not authenticated
- Returns user ID, name, email, and health tracks array
- Tracks are sorted by creation date (most recent first)

**Integration:**

- Mounted route in `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- Uses existing session middleware
- Follows same pattern as `/api/users` endpoint

### 2. Web Frontend - Dashboard Page

**Files Created:**

- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard component
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/helpers.ts` - API fetch and utility functions
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/test/page.spec.tsx` - Dashboard component tests (7 tests)
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/test/fetch_user_data.spec.ts` - Helper function tests (4 tests)

**Features:**

- ✅ Authentication check with redirect to home if not authenticated
- ✅ Displays user's name in welcome heading
- ✅ Lists all health tracks in responsive grid layout
- ✅ Each health track is clickable and links to `/dashboard/tracks/[trackId]`
- ✅ Loading state while fetching data
- ✅ Error state with error message
- ✅ Empty state when user has no tracks
- ✅ Uses shadcn Card components for consistent UI
- ✅ Follows component-structure rules with render functions

**Component Structure:**
The dashboard follows best practices with separate render functions:

- `renderLoading()` - Loading state
- `renderError()` - Error state
- `renderEmptyState()` - No tracks state
- `renderHealthTracks()` - Health tracks grid
- `renderContent()` - Main content orchestration

### 3. shadcn/ui Integration

**Component Added:**

- `apps/web/src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Card component from shadcn/ui

**Usage:**

- Card - Container for health track
- CardHeader - Header section
- CardTitle - Track title display
- CardDescription - Track description display

### 4. Documentation

**Files Created:**

- `about_project/web/DASHBOARD.md` - Complete dashboard feature documentation
- `about_project/api/ENDPOINTS.md` - API endpoints reference
- Updated `about_project/api/TEST_API.md` - Added /api/user/me endpoint test

## Test Results

### All Tests Pass ✅

```
Test Suites: 7 passed, 7 total
Tests:       32 passed, 32 total
```

### Dashboard Tests (11 total)

**Page Component (7 tests):**

- ✅ Redirect when not authenticated
- ✅ Display loading state
- ✅ Display user name when authenticated
- ✅ Display health tracks list
- ✅ Display empty state
- ✅ Display error state
- ✅ Clickable links to track detail pages

**Helper Functions (4 tests):**

- ✅ Successful fetch returns user with tracks
- ✅ Handle 401 unauthorized error
- ✅ Handle network errors
- ✅ Handle API errors with custom messages

## Technical Highlights

### TDD Approach

- Wrote all tests before implementation
- Tests drove the design and implementation
- 100% test coverage for new features

### Component Structure Rules

- Followed component-structure rules strictly
- Used render functions to break down complex JSX
- Clean main return statement
- Separated concerns effectively

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- 1 column on mobile
- 2 columns on tablet
- 3 columns on desktop
- Smooth hover animations

### Type Safety

- Full TypeScript support
- Proper interfaces for all data structures
- Type-safe API responses

### Authentication

- Seamless integration with Better Auth
- Session-based authentication
- Automatic redirect for unauthenticated users

```

## Next Steps

The following features can be built on this foundation:

1. **Track Detail Page** (`/dashboard/tracks/[trackId]`)

   - Display events for a specific health track
   - Add/edit/delete events
   - Upload files for events

2. **Create Track Feature**

   - Add button on dashboard to create new tracks
   - Form with title and description
   - POST endpoint for track creation

3. **Track Management**

   - Edit track details
   - Delete tracks
   - Archive tracks

4. **Enhanced Dashboard**
   - Search and filter tracks
   - Sort by various criteria
   - Display statistics (event counts, last updated)
   - Recent activity feed

## Integration Notes

### API Configuration

- API runs on `http://localhost:8787`
- Web app runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- CORS configured for cross-origin requests
- Credentials included in all API requests

### Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8787
```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Dashboard page at `/dashboard` route
✅ Displays authenticated user's name
✅ Lists all health tracks from database
✅ Each track is clickable (links to future events page)
✅ Follows TDD with tests written first
✅ Uses shadcn components
✅ Follows component-structure rules
✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ All tests passing (32/32)
