Users upload their own files (letters, lab results, appointment notes).
No NHS integration.
No clinical features.

What you MUST do at this stage

These are the minimum legal + technical responsibilities:

1. GDPR basics (only the essentials)

Explicit user consent for storing health data

Privacy Policy (simple, honest, plain language)

Terms of Use

A way for users to:

delete their account + all data

download their data

Define a retention policy (e.g., delete 30 days after account deletion)

2. DPIA (light version)

You do need a DPIA because you handle health data

But a light DPIA is fine since data is user-uploaded and user-controlled

No need for external legal review yet

3. Security requirements you should build NOW (to avoid rework later)

These are future-proof but simple:

Encryption at rest (AES-256 via your cloud provider is fine)

Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)

Zero plaintext access (encrypt sensitive fields, limit admin dashboards)

Basic access logging (who accessed what, when)

No staff access to user files unless explicitly authorised

4. Architecture

Build backend with future NHS/FHIR integration in mind

Use user-scoped encryption keys (or plan for them)

Store metadata separately (e.g., title, date, tags)

Store files in a bucket (S3, GCS) with access tokens + signed URLs only
